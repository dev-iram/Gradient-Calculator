  ## Purpose  
  The purpose of this application is to run a simple calculator on an Android device. I designed the UI to be simple and easy to read, and therefore easy to use!  
  
  I wanted a simple UI design, so I implemented gradient backgrounds which change colours every few seconds that I believed helped me to achieve this. I used this application as a starting point to further my skills and knowledge in XML Layouts/UI Design in Android.   
  
  Within this application, I applied ConstraintLayout as the main layout for the XML layout. The XML layout uses only ConstraintLayout, with the use of the Table ViewGroup to help achieve rows and columns within the application for the placement of the calculator buttons. I also removed the action bar title from the application to ensure that the application is full screen and remains the center of the user's focus. 
  
   I used AnimationDrawable for the animation of the gradient background.  Listeners (setOnClickListener, appendOnClick) for the use of the buttons and operators. Implemented the use of Toast message to display errors automatically generated by Android Studio when exceptions are caught.
